# Peacekeeping Smulations

## **TO DO: if BRDs never hit 0, there's currenly a `None` output. This should be changed to show the > 0 changes**

This repo is my attempts at simulating the effects of peacekeeping opperations. I'm starting simple and building complexity as I go. Currently, `app.py` is a simulation that looks at the monthly effect of PKO troops on battle-related deaths based on the findings of Hultman, Kathman, & Shannon (2014). It creates a web app using `streamlit` which allows the user to change the values with sliders.
